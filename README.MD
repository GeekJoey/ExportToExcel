ExportToExcel
==================
I found a ExportToExcel App in Salesforce AppExchange, however it is not open source, so I post this repo.

</a>

# Notes
* This package is based on <a href="https://github.com/Karanraj/ExportfromListView">ExportfromListView</a>, I made some change on it.
* In order to make sure it works, after deployed, you should update the ListViewRest remote site to your instance
